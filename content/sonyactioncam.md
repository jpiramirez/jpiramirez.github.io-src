Summary: My attempts at using the live preview of a Sony ActionCam

Model: HDR-AS100V

Through the application of nmap I found an IP and port for the camera.

IP: 192.168.122.1
Port: 10000

But I haven’t found the proper URL to access the MJPEG stream. So far all I get are 404s from the embedded http server.

I’ll edit this post if I find more info…
